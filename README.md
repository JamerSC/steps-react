2. Persist local variable renders.

- The Mechanics of State

1. It was developed by Facebook and has gained massive adoption within the web development community due to its simplicity, performance, and reusability. React follows a Declarative programming paradigm, which is a fundamental concept that makes it easier to build complex user interfaces efficiently.
2. Imperative programming is a paradigm in which code explicitly describes the sequence of steps required to achieve a certain result. In the context of React, imperative programming involves manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) directly to update the user interface.

- REACT is called "REACT" because react reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI. DATE <-> US are Synced
